# Causal Dynamical Triangulations in (1+1)D and (2+1)D

This repository contains code and documentation for simulating and studying causal dynamical triangulations (CDT) in both (1+1)D and (2+1)D spacetime dimensions.

## Introduction

Causal Dynamical Triangulations is an approach to quantum gravity, where spacetime is approximated by a simplicial complex. The dynamics of spacetime is described through the evolution of this complex, which is constructed by gluing together simple building blocks known as simplices. In (1+1)D and (2+1)D, these simplices are triangles and tetrahedra respectively.

## Repository Structure

- **`src/`**: Contains the source code for simulating CDT in both dimensions.
